# min4j
This is a self-contained library of subroutines for performing local and global optimization of non-linear functions (some state-of-the-art), written entirely in Java. It consists of:
1. existing subroutines, often written originally in other programming languages (mostly Fortran and C/C++) and provided generously for the benefit of the public, that were translated to Java
2. algorithms implemented from scratch based on existing literature.

**This library is a work in progress (read: beta version). Detailed testing of current algorithms still remains to be done, and many additional features and algorithms will be added in the future.**

## Requirements
This package only requires JRE >= 1.8. That's it!

## License
The code, packaged as a single library, is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (version 2 or later). However, some subroutines can be used independently under more flexible licenses (typically MIT or BSD license). The license type or license header are listed at the top of each code file.
