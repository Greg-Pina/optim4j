# min4j
This is a self-contained library of subroutines for performing local and global optimization of non-linear functions (some state-of-the-art), written entirey in Java. It is mostly a collection of existing routines translated from other programming languages; however, a considerable number of algorithms were implemented from scratch based on academic papers. 

**This library is a work in progress (read: beta version). Detailed testing of current algorithms still remains to be done, and many additional features and algorithms will be added in the future.**

## Requirements
This package only requires JRE >= 1.8. That's it!
